## Design

### Color Scheme

The website uses a color scheme of Red, white and black which are the colours of the UFC branding. People familiar with the UFC would immediately recognise this colour scheme. I also highlighted some parts of the site in gold which is used to represent UFC gold championship belts. 

### Imagery 

Images were used with the permission of the owners and taken from royalty free sites. 

### Wireframe 

The Wireframe was created using Balsamiq 

### Features

There are two pages on this site, the home page with the quiz and another page with instructions on how the quiz works. 

When the user accesses the site, they are imediately greeted with a UFC logo and title stating it is a quiz, so the intention of the site should be immediately clear to the user.

There is also a "How to play" button so the user can find additional instructions on how the quiz works.

When the user selects an answer, the selected answer will turn gold if they got the question right, or red if they got it wrong, as indicated in the how to page. If they get the answer correct, their score will update at the bottom of the page. This continues until the user answers 10 questions and the quiz then ends and displays their score, along with a message that changes depending on the score achieved.
